## BusMall Lab
1. Data Files:
    - JS file containing our products
    - DATA ARRAY (products) needs key value pairs
        - id, image, names
        - the data will be sent to local storage 
    - exported to...

2. 3. HTML & JS FILES
    - one HTML file for survey portion
    - JS file is grabbing 3 random images from data array and allow the user to select one of them
        - the amount of time an image is displayed has a counter that increases 
            - math.random function communicates with whatever function we write to read radio buttons * 
        - pull from local storage
        - push information to local storage which is responding to our radio buttons 
        - radio buttons 
        - this will run 25 times TOTAL
        - every time a button is clicked/submitted, the play count decreases
            if play count is ZERO redirect to results page

    - second HTML file is where results appear
    - JS file contains a function 
        - pull from local storage 
        - push all time results to local storage *
        - the function prints out a list of the name of the item and how often it's chosen 

4. Individual user sessesion should restart
    - Next button / Reset button

5. Non-duplicating images automatically display
    - refer to the way Dani wrote this code for two images 
    - comparison of two functions, each of which contained ids that were being compared as well

6. Results page: how many time products were viewed + votes received
    - the function prints out a list of the name of the item and how often it's chosen 
    - the amount of time an image is displayed has a counter that increases 
        - math.random function communicates with whatever function we write to read radio buttons * 

7. Create a separate page for the following:
    - second HTML file is where results appear
    - JS file contains a function 
        - pull from local storage 
        - push all time results to local storage *
        - the function prints out a list of the name of the item and how often it's chosen
